So far i have implemented following things and abstract them in their own ready to use seperated classes
1. OpenGL window
2. Buffers(index and vertex)
3. VertexArray
4. VertexBufferLayout
5. Shader
6. Textures
7. Input manager
8. Layer stack
9. Orthographic camera (with movement and rotation controls)
10. TimeStep
11. Perspective Camera with movements

 And implemented a test sandbox application with a test layer which renders few quads with textures omn them with a controllable perspective camera
